# CIND-820-Project Review Sentiment Analysis

The following project aims to classify review data from the yelp dataset based on text reviews. I attempt to classify positive or negative sentiments using a subsection of data provided by yelp (https://www.kaggle.com/yelp-dataset/yelp-dataset). Text is preprocessed and is later fed using TF-IDF for the feature selection phase. The last stage involves classifying the data using 3 classification models: Naive Bayes, Random Forst, and Support Vector Machine. I will then analyze the models performance and use the best one for predicting review sentiment.
